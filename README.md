# NodeJS-Elasticsearch
NodeJS application with Elasticsearch as Client

In this project we are using nodejs to create a few apis(Create, Update, Delete and Search) to connect to localhost Elasticsearch.
The apis are called using Postman.
The project also uses cors to connect with the front-end app created using Angular.
